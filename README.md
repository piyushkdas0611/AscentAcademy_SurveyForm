# AscentAcademy_SurveyForm
## Live site url: http://bit.ly/3lcBqzt

Survey form to gather information from the users. This could be feedback, information from
customers, or data for research purposes. I have used HTML to build the structure of the survey
form and to create the fields the users have to fill (name, age, gender, details of contact). CSS has
done the styling. JavaScript is for tasks associated with validation such as e-mail ID and character
limit.
